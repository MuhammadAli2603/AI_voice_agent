Payment is required at the time of enrollment unless using an approved payment plan. We accept major credit cards, PayPal, and other payment methods. Prices are subject to change. A 14-day refund period applies to most courses - full refunds available if requested within 14 days of purchase. Subscription plans can be cancelled anytime with access through the current billing period. Refunds may take 5-10 business days to process.

EduLearn Refund Policy

Effective Date: January 1, 2024

Individual Courses - 14-Day Money-Back Guarantee:
We offer a full refund if you request it within 14 days of enrolling in an individual course. This applies regardless of how much content you've consumed. To request a refund, go to your account settings and click "Request Refund" or contact student services at support@edulearn.com. Refunds are processed within 5-10 business days to your original payment method.

After the 14-day period, refunds are not available. However, you maintain lifetime access to the course materials and can continue learning at your own pace.

Subscription Plans:
Monthly and annual subscription plans can be cancelled at any time. Upon cancellation, you'll retain access to subscription content through the end of your current billing period. No refunds are provided for unused time within the billing period. For example, if you cancel on day 15 of a monthly plan, you'll have access for the remaining 15 days but won't receive a refund for those days.

If you're charged in error or experience technical issues preventing access, contact us within 7 days for a refund consideration.

Specializations and Professional Certificates:
Multi-course programs (specializations, professional certificates) follow the same 14-day refund policy from the date of enrollment in the program. Individual course refunds within a specialization are not available - refunds apply to the entire program.
