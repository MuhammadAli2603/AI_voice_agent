HealthPlus Appointment and Cancellation Policy

Effective Date: January 1, 2024

Scheduling Appointments:
Appointments can be scheduled through our patient portal (available 24/7), by calling 1-800-HEALTH-1 during business hours, or using our mobile app. We strive to accommodate your scheduling preferences and offer appointments at times convenient for you. Same-day appointments are available for urgent medical needs.

Arriving for Your Appointment:
Please arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled appointment time to complete check-in procedures. For first-time patients, arriving 30 minutes early is recommended to complete registration. Bring your insurance card, photo ID, and payment for any copay or outstanding balance. If you arrive more than 15 minutes late, we may need to reschedule your appointment.

Cancellation Policy:
We understand that schedules change and emergencies arise. However, when appointments are missed or cancelled with short notice, it prevents other patients from being seen. Please provide at least 24 hours notice when cancelling or rescheduling appointments.

Missed Appointment Fees:
- First missed appointment: Warning, no fee
- Second missed appointment within 12 months: $25 fee
- Third missed appointment within 12 months: $50 fee and may affect future scheduling

Exceptions are made for true emergencies and documented medical reasons. Same-day illness-related cancellations are typically excused with advance notification.

HealthPlus Financial Policy and Billing

Effective Date: January 1, 2024

Insurance Verification:
It is the patient's responsibility to understand their insurance coverage and benefits. We verify insurance eligibility at the time of scheduling, but this does not guarantee payment by your insurance company. You are responsible for knowing your plan's copays, deductibles, and coverage limitations.

Payment at Time of Service:
Payment for copays, deductibles, and non-covered services is expected at the time of service. We accept cash, checks, credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express), and HSA/FSA cards. If you are unable to pay your copay at the time of service, please speak with our billing staff about payment arrangements.

Insurance Filing:
HealthPlus will file claims with your insurance company as a courtesy to you. We participate with most major insurance carriers as in-network providers. For out-of-network services, we will provide you with the necessary information to file your own claim if your plan allows out-of-network benefits.

Billing Statements:
You will receive a bill for any amount not covered by insurance, including deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. Bills are typically mailed 30-45 days after your visit, once insurance has processed the claim. Statements are sent monthly if a balance remains.

Payment Plans:
We understand that medical expenses can be burdensome. Interest-free payment plans up to 12 months are available for balances over $500. Contact our billing department at 1-800-HEALTH-1 ext. 3 to set up a payment plan. Automatic monthly payments can be arranged for your convenience.

Financial Assistance:
HealthPlus offers financial assistance to patients who meet income and asset guidelines. Financial assistance applications are available on our website, at registration desks, and through our billing department. Decisions on financial assistance are typically made within 30 days of receiving a complete application.

Self-Pay Patients:
Patients without insurance can receive discounted self-pay rates. Payment is expected at the time of service or payment arrangements must be made in advance. Ask about our self-pay discount program when scheduling your appointment.

Past Due Accounts:
Accounts more than 90 days past due may be sent to an external collection agency. We will make reasonable efforts to contact you before taking this step. Collection accounts may be reported to credit bureaus and may affect your credit score.

HealthPlus Prescription Medication Policy

Effective Date: January 1, 2024

Prescribing Practices:
HealthPlus providers follow evidence-based prescribing guidelines to ensure safe and effective medication use. All prescriptions are entered electronically and sent directly to your pharmacy. Handwritten prescriptions are rarely used except when electronic systems are unavailable.

Prescription Refills:
Request refills through:
- Patient portal (preferred method - available 24/7)
- Mobile app
- Calling your pharmacy directly (they will contact us)
- Calling our office during business hours

Refill requests are typically processed within 24-48 hours during business days. Please request refills before you run out of medication. Some medications require an office visit before refills can be authorized, particularly if you haven't been seen in over a year.

Controlled Substances:
Controlled substances (such as opioids, stimulants, and benzodiazepines) are prescribed according to state and federal regulations and HealthPlus policies:
- May require signed controlled substance agreements
- Typically no early refills (must be due for refill)
- May require periodic drug screening and pill counts
- Cannot be called in or faxed; electronic prescription only
- Lost or stolen controlled substances may not be replaced
- One prescribing provider only (no "doctor shopping")

Patients on chronic controlled substances must have regular office visits to monitor efficacy, side effects, and appropriate use.

Antibiotic Prescribing:
Antibiotics are prescribed only when medically appropriate. Many common illnesses like colds, flu, and most sinus infections are caused by viruses and do not require antibiotics. Our providers follow antibiotic stewardship guidelines to prevent antibiotic resistance. If antibiotics are not prescribed for your viral illness, rest assured this is in your best interest.

Mail Order Pharmacy:
Many insurance plans offer mail order pharmacy services for maintenance medications (those taken regularly for chronic conditions). This can save money and provide 90-day supplies. Contact your insurance company or use our pharmacy services to set up mail order.

Medication Samples:
When available, providers may dispense medication samples for short-term use or to trial a new medication before filling a full prescription. Sample availability varies. Insurance companies do not cover sample medications.

Prior Authorization:
Some medications require prior authorization from your insurance company before they will be covered. Our office will submit the necessary paperwork, but approval can take 3-7 business days or longer. In urgent situations, ask your pharmacy about paying cash for a short supply while waiting for authorization.
